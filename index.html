          <p>The ICFP Programming Contest 2014 is the 17th instance of the annual programming contest series sponsored by The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming.</p>
<p>This year, the contest starts on <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=1440&amp;iso=20140725T12&amp;msg=ICFP%20Programming%20Contest%202014">Friday 25 July 2014 at 12:00 UTC</a> and ends on Monday 28 July 2014 at 12:00 UTC. There will be a lightning division, ending on Saturday 26 July 2014 at 12:00 UTC.</p>
<p>This is an open contest. Anybody may participate except for the contest organisers and members of the same group as the the contest chairs. No advance registration or entry fee is required. Contestants are free to organize themselves into teams of any size.</p>
<p>Any programming language(s) on any platform(s) may be used.</p>
<p>There will be cash prizes for the first and second place teams, the team winning the lightning divison, and a discretionary judges’ prize. There may also be travel support for the winning teams to attend the conference.</p>
<p>In addition, the organisers will declare during the conference that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first place team’s language is “the programming language of choice for discriminating hackers”,</li>
<li>the second place team’s language is “a fine tool for many applications”,</li>
<li>the winning lightning division team’s language is “very suitable for rapid prototyping”, and</li>
<li>the team winning the judges’ prize is “an extremely cool bunch of hackers”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional announcements will be made at <a href="http://icfpcontest.org/">http://icfpcontest.org/</a>, including the rules and details of the task.</p>
