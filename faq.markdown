Question: What happens when the Lambda-Man moves into an empty square and a fruit
appears in that same tick? In the next Lambda-Man move scheduled for 127 ticks
ahead, or 137?

Answer: 127. In this extremely rare scenario, the fruit basically is pushed right
into Lambda-Man's mouth, and doesn't slow him down. This is because he schedules
his next move right after he moves, which is before the fruit appears, so he
technically isn't eating at that stage.
