**GAME OVER!**
--------------

Good news! Amongst the dusty archives we found the original technical report
that must have inspired the design of the quirky Lambda-Man CPU. You can find
a [scan of this report online](http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/publications/trs/papers/129.pdf).
So the Lambda-Man CPU turns out to be a hardware implementation of the
[SECD machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECD_machine). We did wonder why
the CPU registers were called `%s` `%e` `%c` and `%d`!

We will be announcing the final results (aka HALL OF FAME) of the competition
at [ICFP (Gothenburg, Sweden; September 1–3, 2014)](http://icfpconference.org/icfp2014/index.html). We will then publish the final rankings including the team home
pages you supplied.

In the meantime we encourage you to publish your solutions and write-ups, and
submit links to them on the [icfpcontest subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/icfpcontest).

We also plan to open source our reference implementation and the HALL OF FAME
server code after the results have been announced. The judges decisions
(including quirks and bugs in our implementation) are final.

* **GAME OVER!**
* The full round is [nearly over](http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20140728T12&p0=1440&msg=ICFP+Programming+Contest+2014+-+End+of+Full+Round)! Time to get your [submission in](http://icfpcontest.org/spec-extra.html#submission-procedure)! Remember, you can update your submission up until the final deadline.
* The [HALL OF FAME](hall-of-fame.html) now has some new maps, an easy and one hard one. I ain't afraid of no ghosts!
* Wow! You can now enter the [HALL OF FAME](hall-of-fame.html) by submitting your Lambda-Man AIs! (no longer accepting entries)
* [Sunday 27th 13:45 UTC] We have updated the reference implementation to correct a [subtle bug in the mechanics](https://github.com/icfpcontest2014/icfpcontest2014.github.io/commit/12fc72d6082820c2035f1da28dd9dd718fb3db77), so it should now be correct with respect to the specification.
* Great news, we've uncovered more dusty '80s documents and have more fun for you! See the [additional task specification for the full round](spec-extra.html). This is a supplement to the existing [base specification](specification.html).
* The lightning round is [nearly over!](http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20140726T12&p0=1440&msg=ICFP+Programming+Contest+2014+-+End+of+Lightning+Round) Get your [submissions in](specification.html#submission-procedure) and check back here for the twist for the full round!
* We have added some more sample maps to the [reference material](reference.html).
* We have added some clarifications to the task specification. You can keep
track of all the changes to the specification by watching the
[commits to this repository](https://github.com/icfpcontest2014/icfpcontest2014.github.io/commits/source).
* We have an [FAQ](faq.html).
* The contest has started! The task specification is available [here](specification.html).

Welcome
-------

The ICFP Programming Contest 2014 is the 17th instance of the annual
programming contest series sponsored by The ACM SIGPLAN International
Conference on Functional Programming.

This year, the contest starts on [Friday 25 July 2014 at 12:00 UTC](http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=1440&iso=20140725T12&msg=ICFP%20Programming%20Contest%202014) and
ends on Monday 28 July 2014 at 12:00 UTC. There will be a lightning
division, ending on Saturday 26 July 2014 at 12:00 UTC.

This is an open contest. Anybody may participate except for the contest
organisers and members of the same group as the the contest chairs. No advance
registration or entry fee is required. Contestants are free to organize
themselves into teams of any size.

Any programming language(s) on any platform(s) may be used.

There will be cash prizes for the first and second place teams, the team
winning the lightning divison, and a discretionary judges’ prize. There may
also be travel support for the winning teams to attend the conference.

In addition, the organisers will declare during the conference that:

* the first place team’s language is “the programming language of choice for
  discriminating hackers”,
* the second place team’s language is “a fine tool for many applications”,
* the winning lightning division team’s language is “very suitable for rapid
  prototyping”, and
* the team winning the judges’ prize is “an extremely cool bunch of hackers”.
